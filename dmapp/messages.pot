"The uncertainties around climate projections are often perceived as an "
"obstacle to their use in real world decision-making situations. The fact "
"that climate change impacts vary according to emission scenarios, climate"
" models and natural variability can put stakeholders in the delicate "
"position of having to agree on climate scenarios before agreeing on "
"adaptation measures. To work around this impediment to action, this "
"project experiments with the Robust Decision Making framework, an "
"approach that could be described as a large-scale sensitivity study "
"mixing climatic and economic variables. In collaboration with Hydro-"
"Qu√©bec and Manitoba Hydro, we've created decision-support tools for two "
"case studies in the hydroelectricity sector. The aim of these studies is "
"to show-case how climate information from multi-model ensembles can be "
"leveraged by decision-makers as expert advice, without getting caught in "
"technical debates about emission scenarios and model selection."

"These studies look at two fictitious situations, one where a utility "
"plans to upgrade the equipment of an existing station, and another where "
"it studies options for a new generating station. For each investment "
"choice, whether it's the number of turbines to rerunner, the total "
"capacity to install or the maximum drawdown of the reservoir, we compute "
"the energy generated over many decades and the revenues from these "
"investment over a range of future conditions. These conditions not only "
"include the climate, that is changes in temperature and precipitations, "
"but also consider the energy market: electricity prices for exports and "
"the discount rate -- the cost of borrowing capital to build or upgrade a "
"power station. The investment choices can be compared between themselves "
"to see which perform best in different future climatic and market "
"conditions."
