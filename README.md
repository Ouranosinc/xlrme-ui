Robust Decision Making (RDM) is a decision-making approach developed at RAND by Robert Lempert and colleagues. It targets decisions plagued by _deep uncertainty_, that is uncertainty so large that it defies concensus about its shape and magnitude. This deep uncertainty is often poorly handled by traditional decision support tools such as sensitivity analyses. The RDM approach suggests a systematic and iterative approach to decision-making, in the spirit of Structured Decision Making (SDM).

As a climate service center, Ouranos is faced with the task of providing useful, actionable information about the future climate to decision-makers and managers. Traditionnaly, this information was delivered in the shape of climate impact studies. That is, climate projections based on different greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions scenarios and global climate models (GCM) were used to drive impact models to provide a picture of the possible impacts of climate change on various issues such as water management, agriculture, infrastructure design or health. These impact studies are however often not sufficient to support decision-making exercises. 

Natural Resources Canada provided funding to Ouranos to explore decision-making approaches with the objective of supporting investment decisions in the hydropower sector. Two case studies were done in collaboration with Hydro-Qu√©bec and Manitoba Hydro. This repository contains the web application built to visualize the results from these case studies, and is populated for demo purposes with synthetic data. This project should be considered as a proof of concept that is evolving toward a more mature implementation.
